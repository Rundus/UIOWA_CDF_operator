# --- Author: C. Feltman ---
# DESCRIPTION: Get the "true" pitch angle that was calculated by the RingCore magnetometer and
# then use it to re-bin the ESA data and collect ChiSquare-Calibrations data
# reduce dataset to only include data after ACS despun rocket since this is where the magPitchAngles are nominal.
# Value is chosen based off of the attitude data variable "SpinAlignmentToB"

# The ChiSquare Calibration values are chosen only AFTER the
# ACS has despun the rocket for nominal data collection, otherwise the
# magnetic field will be very out of line with the ESA detector
