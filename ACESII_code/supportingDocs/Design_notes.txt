The cdf operator must be able to efficiently:
[1] Load in CDF files
[2] Display all the variables in the CDF file
[3] Easily gain access to all the zVariables in the dataso they can be modified
[4] Interface with a universal variables file
[5] Allow new files to read/write to variables file
[6] Write data to new CDF files
[7] Efficiently manage multiple variables. For example: EEPAA_file_high may have counts, counts flux, energy flux, pitch, epoch..etc
