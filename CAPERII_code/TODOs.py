# Calculate the max/min for valid_min_max in Calc_Differential_Flux
#Determine why the true pitch angle data isn't being sent to build_output_file
# Calculate the distribution functions

# Find valid min/max for TRICE distribution functions and CAPERII dist functions

# What is "scale" in the distribution function files

# Are the CAPER fillvalues legit?


# Double check the "build_output_files file outputs to, especcialy the Dflux and Dflux_aligned

# Fix Dist_Function Units
